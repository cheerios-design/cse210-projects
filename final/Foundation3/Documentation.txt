Overview
This C# program is designed to manage different types of events using a class hierarchy with inheritance. 
The program defines a base Event class and three derived classes (ConferenceEvent, ConcertEvent, WeddingEvent). 
Each class encapsulates specific attributes and methods related to its type of event.
