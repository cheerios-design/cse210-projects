Keep track of how many guesses the user has made and inform them of it at the end of the game.

After the game is over, ask the user if they want to play again. Then, 
loop back and play the whole game again and continue this loop as long as they keep saying "yes".

In this version:

The PlayGuessMyNumberGame method encapsulates the logic for playing the game.
The number of guesses is tracked with the numberOfGuesses variable.
After the game is over, the program asks the user if they want to play again. 
If the answer is "yes," it goes back to the beginning of the loop; otherwise, it exits the program.
